# Phasor-Estimation-and-Display-Module
This project involves developing an algorithm for phasor estimation from instantaneous data and creating a polar plot display of the phasors. The algorithm will be implemented on a Raspberry Pi or Arduino Uno, with a phasor display that visualizes the estimated phasors.
